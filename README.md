Notes to note:

Alot of people with access to this script will being using  IDLE, 3.8 built by python. This does work and no problems occur however for a more enjoyable experience please run this script through terminal, to do this, change directories to the main.py folder (will be the folder this is in) and type ‘python3 main.py’ and it will begin to run,

Not Frequently Asked Questions:

What email will the recipient see?

The second of the day will be delivered via ‘tehesecondofthedaybot@gmail.com’ the password for that bot is in the code however if tampered with, (please dont mess with it) I will be updating the password and adding encryption via text file amendment so this isnt possible, the password is only in the code currently to compress the code and help my sleep schedule.

How accurate is this?
As mentioned in the UI, emails arent sent exactly every 1 second, however this is all down to wifi speed. The actual interger given in the email is increddibly accurate to when the email was sent all the way to the 6th decimal place.

How annoying is it?
very. but they can block the email.
Currently working on a more annoying version with block evasion.
